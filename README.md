A versatile IoT development platform, designed to help you accelerate development time, and create performant microcontroller embedded applications.

This board combines hardware & sensors that are widely used in industrial, and internet of things applications, where a right balance of power & performance are required.

Some of the feature of the SoM are:

- Dual core MCU ESP32
- MCP2518FD CAN 2.0B/FD Controller
    - Up to 5Mb/s
    - Software enabled 120 Ohms termination
- AD7689 16-bit ASR Analog to Digital (ADC) converter
    - 8-Inputs
    - Up to 150K samples/second
- MPU9250 Internal Motion Unit (IMU)
    - Accelerometer, Gyroscope & Magnemometer
- BME688 Environmental sensor
    - Temperature, Humidity & Barometric Pressure
- RV-3028 Real Time Clock (RTC)
    - 9 nA current consumption
- Up to 128Gb eMMC memory

This hardware is combined in a System on Module (SoM) with a small footprint, in a 4-layer board, and all signals are routed out through high density connectors.

The reason for this board was to create the bases of a eco-system on electronic control units for a variety of products in the automotive/industrial sector. This allows me to re-use a big percentage of the software across all of these projects.
